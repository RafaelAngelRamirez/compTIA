#### Software Usage Requirements
---

* Compare and contrast general application concepts and uses 
	+ Single-platform software 
		- software that runs only on a single OS or specific CPU type
		- e.g. A software application that may only be installed on a Windows computer.
		- e.g. Software application that can only run on either x86 or ARM architecture (more commonly known as intel)
	+ Cross-platform software
		- software that can run across platforms
			- e.g. Linux and MacOS
		- Compatibility concerns
			- Software that is designed to work in one OS may be "ported" to another OS. This may or may not work as well.  There is no guarantee.
	+ Licensing
		- Single use (one time use)
		- Group use/site license
			+ Volume Licensing
		- Concurrent license
			+ How many are in use at one time.
		- Open source vs. proprietary
			+ Open source (Context or Situation based)
				- e.g. MIT License 
				- e.g. Apache 2.0 
				- e.g. GNU GPLv3 
			+ Proprietary (Owner based and used according to conditions set by the owner)
				- closed-source, user doesn't have access to the source code
	+ Costs
		- Subscription vs. one-time purchase
			+ e.g. Office 365 (Subscription)
				- monthly fee
				- new features are available immediately
			+ e.g. Office 2016 (One-time)
				- one time cost per user
				- new features are available in new versions
	+ Product keys and serial numbers
		+ on OEM https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ProductKey._V192196820.jpg
			- via email from software owner
			- subscription site product licenses
	+ Software installation best practices
		- e.g. install software
		- Reading instructions 
			+ (Linux) https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/linux_repositories.html
				- `sudo apt-get install sublime-text`
			+ (Windows) https://www.wireshark.org/download.html
		- Reading agreements (EULA)
		- Advanced options
